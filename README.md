# `@ubiquibot/automated-merging`

Automatically merge pull-requests based on the reviewer count, the time elapsed since the last activity, depending
on the association of the pull-request author.

## Configuration example

```yml
- plugin: ubiquibot/automated-merging
  name: automated-merging
  id: automated-merging
  description: "Automatically merge pull-requests."
  with:
    approvalsRequired:
      collaborator: 1 # defaults to 1
      contributor: 2 # defaults to 2
    mergeTimeout:
      collaborator: "3.5 days" # defaults to 3.5 days
      contributor: "7 days" # defaults to 7 days
    repos:
      monitor: ["ubiquibot/automated-merging"]
      ignore: ["ubiquibot/automated-merging"]
    allowedReviewerRoles: ["COLLABORATOR", "MEMBER", "OWNER"]
```

## Testing

```shell
bun test
```

## Technical Architecture

### System Components

#### GitHub Action Integration
- Built on TypeScript with strict type checking
- Integrates with GitHub's Actions runtime environment
- Processes webhooks for 'push' and 'issue_comment.created' events
- Manages PR lifecycle through GitHub's REST API

#### Plugin System
The core logic is implemented as a plugin system that:
- Evaluates PRs against configurable rules
- Manages approval workflows
- Handles state transitions
- Processes merge operations

#### Event Processing
- **GitHub Events Handler**: Processes incoming webhooks for:
  - Push events (for base branch updates)
  - Issue comment events (for approval tracking)
- **Summary Generator**: Creates visual PR status reports with:
  - Merge status indicators (üîµ merged, ‚ö´Ô∏è unmerged)
  - Repository monitoring status
  - Configuration overview

### Configuration System

#### Approval Requirements
Configurable thresholds based on contributor status:
```typescript
approvalsRequired: {
  collaborator: number; // Default: 1
  contributor: number; // Default: 2
}
```

#### Merge Timeouts
Customizable waiting periods:
```typescript
mergeTimeout: {
  collaborator: string; // Default: "3.5 days"
  contributor: string; // Default: "7 days"
}
```

#### Repository Monitoring
Fine-grained repository control:
```typescript
repos: {
  monitor: string[]; // Repositories to watch
  ignore: string[];  // Repositories to exclude
}
```

#### Reviewer Roles
Role-based access control:
```typescript
allowedReviewerRoles: string[]; // Default: ["COLLABORATOR", "MEMBER", "OWNER"]
```

### Type System

The project uses a comprehensive type system built on TypeScript:

- **Context Types**: Extends `@ubiquity-os/plugin-sdk` base context
- **Environment Configuration**: Validated through TypeBox schemas
- **Plugin Settings**: Strictly typed configuration options
- **Event Types**: Typed webhook event handling

### Runtime Environment

#### Development
- Bun for testing and development
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Jest for testing framework

#### Production
- Runs in GitHub Actions environment
- Node.js compatibility mode
- TypeBox for runtime type validation

### Data Flow

1. **Event Reception**
   - GitHub webhook triggers Action
   - Event type and payload validated

2. **Configuration Loading**
   - Settings loaded from yml config
   - Environment variables processed
   - Type validation performed

3. **PR Evaluation**
   - Author association checked
   - Review counts tallied
   - Time thresholds evaluated

4. **Merge Processing**
   - Conditions verified
   - Merge operation executed
   - Status updated

5. **Reporting**
   - Summary generated
   - Status posted to PR
   - Monitoring updates logged

This architecture ensures reliable, type-safe automated PR management with configurable rules and comprehensive status reporting.
