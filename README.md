# `@ubiquity-os/daemon-merging`

Automatically merge pull-requests based on the reviewer count, the time elapsed since the last activity, depending
on the association of the pull-request author.

## Configuration example

```yml
- plugin: ubiquity-os-marketplace/daemon-merging
  with:
    approvalsRequired:
      collaborator: 1 # defaults to 1
      contributor: 2 # defaults to 2
    mergeTimeout:
      collaborator: "3.5 days" # defaults to 3.5 days
      contributor: "7 days" # defaults to 7 days
    excludedRepos: ["owner/repo", "another-org/specific-repo"]
    allowedReviewerRoles: ["COLLABORATOR", "MEMBER", "OWNER"]
```

## Testing

```shell
bun run test
```

## Technical Architecture

### System Components

#### GitHub Action Integration

- Built on TypeScript with strict type checking
- Integrates with GitHub's Actions runtime environment
- Processes webhooks for 'push' and 'issue_comment.created' events
- Manages PR lifecycle through GitHub's REST API

#### Plugin System

The core logic is implemented as a plugin system that:

- Evaluates PRs against configurable rules
- Manages approval workflows
- Handles state transitions
- Processes merge operations

#### Event Processing

- **GitHub Events Handler**: Processes incoming webhooks for:
  - Push events (for base branch updates)
  - Issue comment events (for approval tracking)
- **Summary Generator**: Creates visual PR status reports with:
  - Merge status indicators (üîµ merged, ‚ö´Ô∏è unmerged)
  - Repository monitoring status
  - Configuration overview

### Configuration System

#### Approval Requirements

Configurable thresholds based on contributor status:

```typescript
approvalsRequired: {
  collaborator: number; // Default: 1
  contributor: number; // Default: 2
}
```

#### Merge Timeouts

Customizable waiting periods:

```typescript
mergeTimeout: {
  collaborator: string; // Default: "3.5 days"
  contributor: string; // Default: "7 days"
}
```

#### Repository Exclusion

Repositories to exclude from monitoring:

```typescript
excludedRepos: string[]; // Repositories in "owner/repo" format to exclude
```

#### Reviewer Roles

Role-based access control:

```typescript
allowedReviewerRoles: string[]; // Default: ["COLLABORATOR", "MEMBER", "OWNER"]
```

### Type System

The project uses a comprehensive type system built on TypeScript:

- **Context Types**: Extends `@ubiquity-os/plugin-sdk` base context
- **Environment Configuration**: Validated through TypeBox schemas
- **Plugin Settings**: Strictly typed configuration options
- **Event Types**: Typed webhook event handling

### Runtime Environment

#### Development

- Bun for testing and development
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Jest for testing framework

#### Production

- Runs in GitHub Actions environment
- Node.js compatibility mode
- TypeBox for runtime type validation

### Data Flow

1. **Event Reception**

   - GitHub webhook triggers Action
   - Event type and payload validated

2. **Configuration Loading**

   - Settings loaded from yml config
   - Environment variables processed
   - Type validation performed

3. **PR Evaluation**

   - Find PRs linked to the specific issue from the payload
   - Author association checked
   - Review counts tallied
   - Time thresholds evaluated

4. **Merge Processing**

   - Conditions verified
   - Merge operation executed
   - Status updated

5. **Reporting**
   - Summary generated
   - Status posted to PR
   - Monitoring updates logged

This architecture ensures reliable, type-safe automated PR management with configurable rules and comprehensive status reporting.
